"""
Device Binding Module — AI Attendance System
=============================================
Enforces a "one student = one trusted device" policy.

Strategy:
  - Device ID is a UUID generated in the browser and stored in localStorage.
  - On first attendance: device is auto-registered to the student.
  - On subsequent attempts: device ID must match the registered one.
  - Admin can reset the binding if a student legitimately changes device.

This is a SOFT binding (not hardware-level), which is appropriate for
an academic setting where students may occasionally change phones.
